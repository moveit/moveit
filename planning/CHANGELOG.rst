0.5.14 (2014-02-06)
-------------------

0.5.13 (2014-02-06)
-------------------
* remove debug printfs
* planning_scene_monitor: add requestPlanningSceneState()
* planning_scene_monitor: fix race condition
* planning_scene_monitor: fix state update bug
  The rate of state updates is limited to dt_state_update per second.
  When an update arrived it was not processed if another was recently
  processed.  This meant that if a quick sequence of state updates
  arrived and then no updates arrive for a while that the last update(s)
  were not seen until another arrives (which may be much later or
  never). This fixes the bug by periodically checking for pending
  updates and running them if they have been pending longer than
  dt_state_update.
* add default_robot_link_padding/scale, set padding/scale value for each robot link, see https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit_ros/issues/402
* fix LockedPlanningSceneRW docs
  fix the text that was originally copied from another class
  (from LockedPlanningSceneRO)
  it mentioned an incorrect return value type of
  LockedPlanningSceneRW::operator->()
