   * samplers based on a set of criteria - where A and B are two
   * samplers being considered for swapping by a sort algorithm:
   *
   * \li If the set of links updated by the group of A are a proper
   * subset of the set of links updated by the group of B, A and B are
   * not swapped.  If the updated links of B are a proper set of the
   * updated links of A, A and B are swapped.
   *
   * \li Otherwise, the groups associated with A and B are either
   * disjoint in terms of updated links or have an equivalent group.
   * In this case, it is determined if any updated links in the group for A
   * exist in the frame dependency of B, or vice-versa.
   *
   * \li If A depends on B, and B depends on A, a warning message is
   * printed that circular dependencies are likely to lead to bad
   * samples.  A and B are not swapped.
   *
   * \li If one of the frame dependencies of B is a link updated by A,
   * but not vice-versa, the samplers are swapped.
   *
   * \li If one of the frame dependencies of A is a link updated by B,
   * but not vice-versa, the samplers are not swapped.
   *
   * \li If no dependency exists, the samplers are swapped according
   * to alphabetical order.
