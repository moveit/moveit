* Contributors: Ioan A Sucan, Michael Ferguson

0.6.10 (2014-10-27)
-------------------
* Made setVerbose virtual in constraint_sampler so that child classes can override
* Manipulability Index Error for few DOF
  When the group has fewer than 6 DOF, the Jacobian is of the form 6xM and when multiplied by its transpose, forms a 6x6 matrix that is singular and its determinant is always 0 (or NAN if the solver cannot calculate it).
  Since calculating the SVD of a Jacobian is a costly operation, I propose to retain the calculation of the Manipulability Index through the determinant for 6 or more DOF (where it produces the correct result), but use the product of the singular values of the Jacobian for fewer DOF.
* Fixed missing test depends for tf_conversions
* Allow setFromIK() with multiple poses to single IK solver
* Improved debug output
* Removed duplicate functionality poseToMsg function
* New setToRandomPositions function with custom rand num generator

0.5.10 (2014-06-30)
-------------------

* Contributors: Tully Foote

0.5.9 (2014-06-23)
------------------
* Fixed bug in RevoluteJointModel::distance() giving large negative numbers.
* kinematics_base: added an optional RobotState for context.
* fix pick/place approach/retreat on indigo/14.04
* Fixed bug in RevoluteJointModel::distance() giving large negative numbers.
* IterativeParabolicTimeParameterization now ignores virtual joints.
* kinematics_base: added an optional RobotState for context.
* Removed check for multi-dof joints in iterative_time_parameterization.cpp.
* fix pick/place approach/retreat on indigo/14.04
* IterativeParabolicTimeParameterization now ignores virtual joints.
  When checking if all joints are single-DOF, it accepts multi-DOF joints only if they are
  also virtual.
* Fix compiler warnings
* Address [cppcheck: unreadVariable] warning.
* Address [cppcheck: postfixOperator] warning.
* Address [cppcheck: stlSize] warning.
* Address [-Wunused-value] warning.
* Address [-Wunused-variable] warning.
* Address [-Wreturn-type] warning.
* Address [-Wsign-compare] warning.
* Address [-Wreorder] warning.
* Allow joint model group to have use IK solvers with multiple tip frames
* KinematicsBase support for multiple tip frames and IK requests with multiple poses
* dynamics_solver: fix crashbug
  Ignore joint that does not exist (including the virtual joint if it is part of
  the group).
* Changed KinematicsBase::supportsGroup() to use a more standard call signature.
* Merged with hydro-devel
* Removed unnecessary error output
* Removed todo
* Added support for legacy IK calls without solution_callback
* Merge branch 'hydro-devel' into kinematic_base
* Changed KinematicsBase::supportsGroup() to use a more standard call signature.
* Added empty check.
* computeCartesianPath waypoints double-up fix
  computeCartesianPath appends full trajectories between waypoints when given a vector of waypoints. As trajectories include their endpoints, this leads to the combined trajectory being generated with duplicate points at waypoints, which can lead to pauses or stuttering.
  This change skips the first point in trajectories generated between waypoints.
* avoid unnecessary calculations
* Created supportsGroup() test for IK solvers
* from ros-planning/more-travis-tests
  More Travis test fixes.
* Commented out failing test.
  run_tests_moveit_ros_perception requires glut library, and thus a video card or X server, but I haven't had any luck making such things work on Travis.
* avoid unnecessary calculations
  If we are not going to use the missing vector then we should not create it
  (avoid an expensive operation).
* Code cleanup
* Allow joint model group to have use IK solvers with multiple tip frames
* Authorship
* Fixed missing removeSlash to setValues()
* Feedback and cleaned up comment lengths
* Cleaned up commit
* KinematicsBase support for multiple tip frames and IK requests with multiple poses
* More Travis test fixes.
  Switched test_constraint_samplers.cpp from build-time to run-time reference to moveit_resources.
  Added passing run_tests_moveit_core_gtest_test_robot_state_complex test to .travis.yml.
  Added 'make tests' to .travis.yml to make all tests, even failing ones.

  See http://answers.ros.org/question/80936 for details
  Interestingly collision_detection_fcl already uses the correct
  variable ${LIBFCL_LIBRARIES} although it wasn't even set before
