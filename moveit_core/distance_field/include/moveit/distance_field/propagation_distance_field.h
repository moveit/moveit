 * \brief A DistanceField implementation that uses a vector

 * to be computed, which is optional.  Outward and inward propagation
 * only occur to a desired maximum distance - cells that are more than
 * this maximum distance from the nearest cell will have maximum
 * distance measurements.
 *
 * This class uses a \ref VoxelGrid to hold all data.  One important
 * decision that must be made on construction is whether or not to
 * create a signed version of the distance field.  If the distance
 * field is unsigned, it means that the minumum obstacle distance is
 * 0, a value that will be assigned to all obstacle cells.  Gradient
 * queries for obstacle cells will not give useful information, as the
 * gradient at an obstacle cell will point to the cell itself.  If
 * this behavior is acceptable, then the performance of this mode will
 * be more efficient, as no propagation will occur for obstacle cells.
 * The other option is to calculate signed distances.  In this case,
 * negative distances up to the maximum distance are calculated for
 * obstacle volumes.  This distance encodes the distance of an
 * obstacle cell to the nearest unoccupied obstacle voxel.  Furthmore,
 * gradients pointing out of the volume will be produced.  Depending
 * on the data, calculating this data can significantly impact the
 * time it takes to add and remove obstacle cells.
