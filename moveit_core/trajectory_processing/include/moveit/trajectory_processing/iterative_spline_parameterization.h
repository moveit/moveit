/// \brief This class sets the timestamps of a trajectory
/// to enforce velocity, acceleration constraints.
/// Initial/final velocities and accelerations may be specified in the trajectory.
/// Velocity and acceleration limits are specified in the model.
///
/// This algorithm repeatedly fits a cubic spline, adjusts the timing intervals,
/// and repeats until all constraints are satisfied.
/// When finished, each trajectory waypoint will have the time set,
/// as well as the velocities and accelerations for each joint.
/// Since we fit to a cubic spline, the position, velocity, and
/// acceleration will be continuous and within bounds.
/// The jerk will be discontinuous.
///
/// To match the velocity and acceleration at the endpoints,
/// the second and second-last point locations need to move.
/// By default, two extra points are added to leave the original trajectory unaffected.
/// If points are not added, the trajectory could potentially be faster,
/// but the 2nd and 2nd-last points should be re-checked for collisions.
///
/// Migration notes:  If migrating from Iterative Parabolic Time Parameterization,
/// be aware that the velocity and acceleration limits are more strictly enforced
/// using this technique.
/// This means that time-parameterizing the same trajectory with the same
/// velocity and acceleration limits, will result in a longer trajectory.
/// If this is a problem, try retuning (increasing) the limits.
