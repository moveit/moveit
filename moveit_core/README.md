# MoveIt! Core

This repository includes core libraries used by MoveIt:
 - representation of kinematic models
 - collision detection interfaces and implementations
 - interfaces for kinematic solver plugins
 - interfaces for motion planning plugins
 - interfaces for controllers and sensors

These libraries do not depend on ROS (except ROS messages) and can be used independently.
