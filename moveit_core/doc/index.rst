Python API Reference: moveit_core
=======================================

.. note::
    These docs are autogenerated. You may see reference to module names like pymoveit_core,
    but you should not use these in your code. Instead, use the modules under the `moveit` namespace.
    For example, you should write ``import moveit.core`` instead of ``import pymoveit_core``.
    The latter will still work, but will not contain the full API that ``import moveit.core`` does.
