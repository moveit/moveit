/**
 * \brief Class for constraints on the visibility relationship between
 * a sensor and a target.
 *
 * Visibility constraints are the most complicated kinematic
 * constraint type.  They are designed to test whether a visibility
 * relationship is maintained in a given state.  For the visibility
 * relationship to be maintained, a sensor must have an unimpeded view
 * of a target - this is useful, for instance, if one wants to test
 * whether a robot can see its hand with a given sensor in a given
 * state.  The mechanism that is used to test the constraint is a
 * combination of geometric checks, and then a collision check that
 * tests whether a cone that connects the sensor and the target is
 * entirely unobstructed by the robot's links.
 *
 * The constraint consists of a sensor pose, a target pose, a few
 * parameters that govern the shape of the target, and a few
 * parameters that allow finer control over the geometry of the check.
 * There are two general ways that this constraint can be used.  The
 * first way to leave max_view_angle and max_range_angle in the
 * VisibilityConstraint message as 0.0.  In this case, the only check
 * that is performed is the collision check against the cone.  This
 * check assumes that the sensor can see in all directions - the
 * orientation of the sensor has no effect on the creation of the
 * cone.  It is important to note that the sensor and the target poses
 * must not result in collision - if they are associated with sensor
 * frames or robot links they must be specified to be outside the
 * robot's body or all states will violate the Visibility Constraint.
 * For an example of a visualization of a visibility constraint
 * (produced using the getMarkers member function), see this image:
 *
 * \image html fingertip_cone.png "Visibility constraint satisfied as cone volume is clear"
 *
 * The cone is shown in red, and the arrows show normals.  This
 * visibility constraint uses a sensor pose (the narrow end of the
 * cone ) of the PR2's narrow_stereo_optical_frame, except shifted
 * along the Z axis such that the pose is outside of the robot's head
 * and doesn't collide.  The cone is allowed to collide with the
 * actual sensor associated with the header frame, just not with any
 * other links.  The target pose is a 5 cm circle offset from the
 * l_gripper_r_finger_tip_link, again so as not to collide - again,
 * the cone can collide with the target link, but now with any other
 * links.  In the indicated state the cone is collision free and thus
 * satisfies the collision component of the visibility constraint.  In
 * this image, however, the right arm intersects the cone, violating
 * the visibility constraint:
 *
 * \image html fingertip_collision.png "Visibility constraint violated as right arm is within the cone"
 *
 * Note that both the target and the sensor frame can change with the
 * robot's state.
 *
 * The collision check essentially asks whether or not the volume
 * between the sensor pose and the target pose are clear, but that's
 * only one aspect of visibility we may care about. The visibility
 * constraint also allows for some geometric reasoning about the
 * relationship between the sensor or the target - this allows
 * information such as approximate field of view of the sensor to be
 * factored into the constraint.  To use this reasoning, the
 * sensor_view_direction of the field should first be set - this
 * specifies which axis of the sensor pose frame is actually pointing.
 * The system assumes that the the sensor pose has been set up such
 * that a single of the axes is pointing directly out of the sensor.
 * Once this value is set correctly, one or both of the max_view_angle
 * and the max_range_angle values can be set.  Setting a positive
 * max_view_angle will constrain the sensor along the specified axis
 * and the target along its Z axis to be pointing at each other.
 * Practically speaking, this ensures that the sensor has sufficient
 * visibility to the front of the target - if the target is pointing
 * the opposite direction, or is too steeply perpindicular to the
 * target, then the max_view_angle part of the constraint will be
 * violated.  The getMarkers function can again help explain this -
 * the view angle is the angular difference between the blue arrow
 * associated with the sensor and the red arrow associated with the
 * target.

 * \image html exact_opposites.png "Max view angle is evaluated at 0.0"
 * \image html fourty_five.png "Max view angle evaluates around pi/4"
 * \image html perpindicular.png "Max view angle evaluates at pi/2, the maximum"
 * \image html other_side.png "Sensor pointed at wrong side of target, will violate constraint as long as max_view_angle
 > 0.0"
 *
 * If constraining the target to be within the field of view of the
 * sensor is the goal, then the max_range_angle can be set.  The range
 * angle is calculated as the angle between the origins of the sensor
 * and the target frame - the orientations are unimportant.  In the
 * above images, the range angle is always 0, as the target's center
 * is directly lined up with the blue arrow.  In this image, however,
 * the view angle is evaluated at 0.0, while the range angle is
 * evaluated at .65.
 *
 * \image html range_angle.png "Range angle is high, so only sensors with wide fields of view would see the target"
 *
 * By limiting the max_range_angle, you can constrain the target to be
 * within the field of view of the sensor.  Max_view_angle and
 * max_range_angle can be used at once.
