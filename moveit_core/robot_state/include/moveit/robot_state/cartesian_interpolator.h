  /** \brief Compute the sequence of joint values that correspond to a straight Cartesian path for a particular group.

     The Cartesian path to be followed is specified as a direction of motion (\e direction, unit vector) for the origin
     The Cartesian path to be followed is specified as a direction of motion (\e direction, unit vector) for the origin
     of a robot link (\e link). The direction is assumed to be either in a global reference frame or in the local
     reference frame of the link. In the latter case (\e global_reference_frame is false) the \e direction is rotated
     accordingly. The link needs to move in a straight line, following the specified direction, for the desired \e
     distance. The resulting joint values are stored in the vector \e traj, one by one. The maximum distance in
     Cartesian space between consecutive points on the resulting path is specified in the \e MaxEEFStep struct which
     provides two fields: translation and rotation. If a \e validCallback is specified, this is passed to the internal
     call to setFromIK(). In case of IK failure, the computation of the path stops and the value returned corresponds to
     the distance that was computed and for which corresponding states were added to the path.  At the end of the
     function call, the state of the group corresponds to the last attempted Cartesian pose.

     During the computation of the trajectory, it is usually preferred if consecutive joint values do not 'jump' by a
     large amount in joint space, even if the Cartesian distance between the corresponding points is small as expected.
     To account for this, the \e jump_threshold struct is provided, which comprises three fields:
     \e jump_threshold_factor, \e revolute_jump_threshold and \e prismatic_jump_threshold.
     If either \e revolute_jump_threshold or \e prismatic_jump_threshold  are non-zero, we test for absolute jumps.
     If \e jump_threshold_factor is non-zero, we test for relative jumps. Otherwise (all params are zero), jump
     detection is disabled.

     For relative jump detection, the average joint-space distance between consecutive points in the trajectory is
     computed. If any individual joint-space motion delta is larger then this average distance by a factor of
     \e jump_threshold_factor, this step is considered a failure and the returned path is truncated up to just
     before the jump.

     For absolute jump thresholds, if any individual joint-space motion delta is larger then \e revolute_jump_threshold
     for revolute joints or \e prismatic_jump_threshold for prismatic joints then this step is considered a failure and
     the returned path is truncated up to just before the jump.*/
