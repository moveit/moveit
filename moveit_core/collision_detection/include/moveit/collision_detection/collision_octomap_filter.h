/** @brief Re-proceses contact normals for an octomap by estimating a metaball
 *   iso-surface using the centers of occupied cells in a neighborhood of the contact point.
 *
 *  This is an implementation of the algorithm described in:

 *  Surfaces for Constraint-Based Haptic Rendering. ICRA, May 2012, St Paul, MN.

 *
 *  @param The octomap originally used for collision detection.
 *  @param The collision result (which will get its normals updated)
 *  @param The distance, as a multiple of the octomap cell size, from which to include neighboring cells.
 *  @param The minimum angle change required for a normal to be over-written
 *  @param Whether to request a depth estimate from the algorithm (experimental...)
 *  @param The iso-surface threshold value (0.5 is a reasonable default).
 *  @param The metaball radius, as a multiple of the octomap cell size (1.5 is a reasonable default)
