* Added command-line SRDF updater
* Merge pull request from 130s/fix/windowsize
  Shrink window height
* Add scrollbar to the text area that could be squashed.
* Better minimum window size.
* Merge pull request #103  from gavanderhoorn/issue102_cfgrble_db_path
  Fix for issue #102 : allow user to set mongodb db location
* Update warehouse launch file to accept non-standard db location. Fix #102.
  Also update generated demo.launch accordingly.
  The default directory could be located on a non-writable file system, leading
  to crashes of the mongodb wrapper script. This change allows the user to specify
  an alternative location using the 'db_path' argument.

------------------
* Values are now read from kinematics.yaml correctly.

* Added space after every , in function calls
  Added either a space or a c-return before opening {
  Moved & next to the variable in the member function declarations

  Each parameter is set to current defaults. This is fragile, as defaults may change.
