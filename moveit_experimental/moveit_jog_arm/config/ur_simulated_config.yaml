use_gazebo: true # Whether the robot is started in a Gazebo simulation environment

## Properties of incoming commands
command_frame:  world  # TF frame that incoming cmds are given in
command_in_type: "speed_units" # "unitless"> in the range [-1:1], as if from joystick. "speed_units"> cmds are in m/s and rad/s
scale: # Only used if command_in_type=="unitless"
  linear:  0.6  # Max linear velocity. Meters per publish_period. Units is [m/s]
  rotational:  0.3 # Max angular velocity. Rads per publish_period. Units is [rad/s]
  joint: 0.3  # Max joint angular/linear velocity. Rads or Meters per publish period. Units is [rad/s] or [m/s].
low_pass_filter_coeff: 2.  # Larger --> trust the filtered data more, trust the measurements less.

## Properties of outgoing commands
publish_period: 0.008  # 1/Nominal publish rate [seconds]
publish_delay: 0.005  # delay between calculation and execution start of command

# What type of topic does your robot driver expect?
# Currently supported are std_msgs/Float64MultiArray (for ros_control JointGroupVelocityController or JointGroupPositionController)
# or trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory (for Universal Robots and other non-ros_control robots)
command_out_type: std_msgs/Float64MultiArray

# What to publish? Can save some bandwidth as most robots only require positions or velocities
publish_joint_positions: true
publish_joint_velocities: false
publish_joint_accelerations: false

## MoveIt properties
move_group_name:  manipulator  # Often 'manipulator' or 'arm'
planning_frame: world  # The MoveIt! planning frame. Often 'base_link'

## Stopping behaviour
incoming_command_timeout:  2  # Stop jogging if X seconds elapse without a new cmd
# If 0, republish commands forever even if the robot is stationary. Otherwise, specify num. to publish.
# Important because ROS may drop some messages and we need the robot to halt reliably.
num_halt_msgs_to_publish: 4

## Configure handling of singularities and joint limits
lower_singularity_threshold:  17  # Start decelerating when the condition number hits this (close to singularity)
hard_stop_singularity_threshold: 30 # Stop when the condition number hits this
joint_limit_margin: 0.1 # added as a buffer to joint limits [radians]. If moving quickly, make this larger.

## Topic names
cartesian_command_in_topic: jog_server/delta_jog_cmds  # Topic for incoming Cartesian twist commands
joint_command_in_topic: jog_server/joint_delta_jog_cmds # Topic for incoming joint angle commands
joint_topic:  joint_states
warning_topic: jog_server/halted # Publish boolean warnings to this topic
command_out_topic: joint_group_position_controller/command # Publish outgoing commands here

## Collision checking
check_collisions: true # Check collisions?
collision_check_rate: 5 # [Hz] Collision-checking can easily bog down a CPU if done too often.
collision_proximity_threshold: 0.01 # Start decelerating when a collision is this far [m]
hard_stop_collision_proximity_threshold: 0.0005 # Stop when a collision is this far [m]
