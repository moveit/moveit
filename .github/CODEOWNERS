# MoveIt! is a large project with pull requests being created often. In order
# to ensure quick review turn around time from our maintainer team, we're
# leveraging an automated "triage" approach to auto-assign reviews to new pull
# requests. If you already know who should review your PR, then you can assign
# them manually. Otherwise, this code owners file will help assign reviewers
# and reduce the amount of email received by maintainers having to "Watch" the
# entire repository.

# When a PR is finished being created ("Create Pull Request" is clicked), the
# codeowner of each file in the PR will be added to the list of reviewers.
# Code owners are maintainers who are familiar with certain parts of the code,
# and thus more likely to review a PR relating to them. Being a code owner
# does not imply authorship, control or ownership in a legal sense.

# Each line in this file is a file pattern followed by one or more
# @github_usernames and/or e-mail addresses corresponding to users with write
# permissions for the repository.
# https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-code-owners

# Order is important; the user(s) in the last matching pattern here for a file will
# be that file's owner(s).

# The users below will be the default owners for everything in the repository.
# Unless a line further in this file matches, all of the users here will be
# requested for review when someone opens a pull request.
