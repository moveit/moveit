## Properties of incoming commands
command_in_type: "speed_units" # "unitless"> in the range [-1:1], as if from joystick. "speed_units"> cmds are in m/s and rad/s
scale:
  # Scale parameters are only used if command_in_type=="unitless"
  linear:  0.003  # Max linear velocity. Meters per publish_period. Unit is [m/s]. Only used for Cartesian commands.
  rotational:  0.006 # Max angular velocity. Rads per publish_period. Unit is [rad/s]. Only used for Cartesian commands.
  # Max joint angular/linear velocity. Rads or Meters per publish period. Only used for joint commands on joint_command_in_topic.
  joint: 0.01
low_pass_filter_coeff: 2.  # Larger --> trust the filtered data more, trust the measurements less.

## Properties of outgoing commands
low_latency_mode: true  # Set this to true to tie the output rate to the input rate
publish_period: 0.01  # 1/Nominal publish rate [seconds]

# What type of topic does your robot driver expect?
# Currently supported are std_msgs/Float64MultiArray (for ros_control JointGroupVelocityController or JointGroupPositionController)
# or trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory (for Universal Robots and other non-ros_control robots)
command_out_type: trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory

# What to publish? Can save some bandwidth as most robots only require positions or velocities
publish_joint_positions: true
publish_joint_velocities: false
publish_joint_accelerations: false

## MoveIt properties
move_group_name:  panda_arm  # Often 'manipulator' or 'arm'
planning_frame: panda_link0  # The MoveIt planning frame. Often 'panda_link0' or 'world'

## Other frames
ee_frame_name: panda_link7  # The name of the end effector link, used to return the EE pose
robot_link_command_frame:  panda_link0  # commands must be given in the frame of a robot link. Usually either the base or end effector

## Stopping behaviour
incoming_command_timeout:  1  # Stop servoing if X seconds elapse without a new command
# If 0, republish commands forever even if the robot is stationary. Otherwise, specify num. to publish.
# Important because ROS may drop some messages and we need the robot to halt reliably.
num_outgoing_halt_msgs_to_publish: 1

## Configure handling of singularities and joint limits
lower_singularity_threshold:  30  # Start decelerating when the condition number hits this (close to singularity)
hard_stop_singularity_threshold: 45 # Stop when the condition number hits this
joint_limit_margin: 0.1 # added as a buffer to joint limits [radians]. If moving quickly, make this larger.

## Topic names
cartesian_command_in_topic: servo_server/delta_twist_cmds  # Topic for incoming Cartesian twist commands
joint_command_in_topic: servo_server/delta_joint_cmds # Topic for incoming joint angle commands
joint_topic:  joint_states
status_topic: servo_server/status # Publish status to this topic
command_out_topic: servo_server/command # Publish outgoing commands here

## Collision checking for the entire robot body
check_collisions: true # Check collisions?
collision_check_rate: 5 # [Hz] Collision-checking can easily bog down a CPU if done too often.
# Two collision check algorithms are available:
# "threshold_distance" begins slowing down when nearer than a specified distance. Good if you want to tune collision thresholds manually.
# "stop_distance" stops if a collision is nearer than the worst-case stopping distance and the distance is decreasing. Requires joint acceleration limits
collision_check_type: stop_distance
# Parameters for "threshold_distance"-type collision checking
self_collision_proximity_threshold: 0.01 # Start decelerating when a collision is this far [m]
scene_collision_proximity_threshold: 0.03 # Start decelerating when a collision is this far [m]
# Parameters for "stop_distance"-type collision checking
collision_distance_safety_factor: 1000 # Must be >= 1. A large safety factor is recommended to account for latency
min_allowable_collision_distance: 0.01 # Stop if a collision is closer than this [m]
