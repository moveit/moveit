# This is an example configuration that loads the "Kitchen" scene from the
# local MoveIt warehouse and benchmarks the "manipulator" group over all pairs
# of motion plan queries and start states in the Kitchen scene.

# Five planners from two different plugins are run a total of 50 times each, with a
# maximum of 10 seconds per run.  Output is stored in the /home/benchmarks directory.
