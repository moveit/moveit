------------------
* changelog 0.7.6
* Contributors: Isaac I.Y. Saito

0.7.5 (2016-12-25)
------------------
* changelog 0.7.5
* Contributors: Isaac I.Y. Saito

0.7.4 (2016-12-22)
------------------
* [indigo][changelog] Add blank 0.7.3 section to those that are missing it.
  Reason why doing this:
  - catkin_generate_changelog gets stuck for some reason so batch generating changelog isn't possible now.
  - Since this is the first release since 6 month ago for Indigo, lots of commit logs since then that shouldn't be wasted.
  - Decided to bump version of all packages uniformely to 0.7.4 in the hope for catkin_generate_changelog to function...
  - Turned out the accumulated commit logs are not retrieved...But we might as well want to move forward to fix https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/386
* Contributors: Isaac I.Y. Saito

0.7.3 (2016-12-20)
------------------
* add full VERSIONs / SONAMEs to all libraries (`#273 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/273>`_)
  This is similar to `#273 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/273>`_ / 0a7a895bb2ae9e171efa101f354826366fa5eaff,
  but hard-codes the version for each library instead of using the project's version.
  Thus, we have to bump the version of a library *manually* if we break ABI in a release.
  === Below is the original commit message of the patch targeting the kinetic branch.
  * add full VERSIONs / SONAMEs to all core libraries
  As a result the libraries do not install as `libmoveit_xyz.so` anymore,
  but as `libmoveit_xyz.so.${MOVEIT_VERSION}` and only provide `libmoveit_xyz.so`
  as a symlink pointing to the versioned file.
  Because this sets each library's SONAME to the *full version*, this enforces
  that *every* binary links with the versioned library file from now on and
  has to be relinked with *each* new release of MoveIt!.
  The alternative would be to set the SONAME to `$MAJOR.$MINOR` and ignore the patch version,
  but because we currently stay with one `$MAJOR.$MINOR` number within each ROS distribution,
  we had (and likely will have) ABI changes in the `$PATCH` version releases too.
  The reason for this commit is that it is practically impossible to maintain full ABI compatibility
  within each ROS distribution and still add the the features/patches the community asks for.
  This has resulted in more than one ABI-incompatible MoveIt! release in the recent past
  within a ROS distribution. Because the libraries have not been versioned up to now,
  there was no way to indicate the incompatible changes and users who did not rebuild
  their whole workspace with the new release encountered weird and hard-to-track segfaults
  or broken behavior.
  * add SONAMES to all non-core libraries too
* Auto code formatted Indigo branch using clang-format (`#313 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/313>`_)
* [package.xml] Fix repository URLs. (`#194 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/194>`_)
* Use MOVEIT_CLASS_FORWARD for moveit classes in moveit_ros. (`#182 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/182>`_) (`#183 <https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/issues/183>`_)
