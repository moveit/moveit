   * dimension in MoveIt, which the planner can (almost) never satisfy. Therefore we use a threshold value, below which

   * This threshold value should be larger than the tolerance of the constraints specified in OMPL
   * (ompl::magic::CONSTRAINT_PROJECTION_TOLERANCE = 1e-4).
   *
   * This is necessary because the constraints are also checked by MoveIt in the StateValidity checker. If this check
   * would use a stricter tolerance than was used to satisfy the constraints in OMPL, all states would be invalid.
   * Therefore the dimension of an equality constraint specified in the constraint message should be at least equal the
   * the tolerance used by OMPL to project onto the constraints. To avoid checking for exact equality on floats, the
   * threshold is made a bit larger.
   *
   * equality_constraint_threshold_ > tolerance in constraint message > OMPL projection tolerance
   *
   * That's why the value is 1e-3 > 1e-4.
   * Now the user can specify any value between 1e-3 and 1e-4 to specify an equality constraint.
