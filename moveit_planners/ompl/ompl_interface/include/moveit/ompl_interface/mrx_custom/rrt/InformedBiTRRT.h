/// @par Short description
/// This planner grows two T-RRTs, one from the start and one from the
/// goal, and attempts to connect the trees somewhere in the middle.
/// T-RRT is an RRT variant and tree-based motion planner that takes into consideration state costs
/// to compute low-cost paths that follow valleys and saddle points of the configuration-space
/// costmap. It uses transition tests from stochastic optimization methods to accept or reject new
/// potential states.
