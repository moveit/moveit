## This file allows developers to set breakpoints in the CPP_EXECUTABLE_NAME.launch file
## To set a breakpoint, compile with debug flag set to true. Add a line below with the source file name,
## a colon, then the line number to break on. Then launch CPP_EXECUTABLE_NAME with argument debug:=true

set breakpoint pending on

## Example break point:
# break CPP_EXECUTABLE_NAME.cpp:52
