MoveIt! fake controllers
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

MoveIt! comes with a series of fake trajectory controllers to be used in simulation.
For example, the ``demo.launch`` generated by MoveIt's setup assistant, employs fake controllers for nice visualization in rviz.

For configuration, edit the file ``config/fake_controllers.yaml``, and adjust the desired controller type.
The following controllers are available:

* **interpolate**: perform smooth interpolation between via points - the default for visualization
* **via points**:  traverse via points, w/o interpolation in between - useful for visual debugging
* **last point**:  warp directly to the last point of the trajectory - fastest method for offline benchmarking

.. code:: yaml

   rate: 10 (Hz, used for interpolation controller)
   controller_list:
     - name: fake_arm_controller
       type: interpolate | via points | last point
       joints:
         - joint_1
         - joint_2
         - joint_3
         - joint_4
         - joint_5
         - joint_6
     - name: fake_gripper_controller
       joints:
         []

In order to load an initial pose, one can have a list of (group, pose) pairs as follows:

.. code:: yaml

   initial:
     - group: arm
       pose:  home
